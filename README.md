A fun project I started a couple of years ago where I made a basic and dirty 3d engine in Java. The rendering is done inside a JComponent.paintComponent method, so all the 3d transformations and logic are done from scratch.

Features:
- A camera that can be moved with WASD. Never got to implement camera rotation.
- Ambient & directional light.
- Rendering basic shapes with position, rotation, scale and color.
